        <span class="brödtext" id="first-paragraph">From June 1992 to March 1995, in the midst of the AIDS crisis in NYC, an extraordinary theatrical collective emerged from the queer underground. 
            Blacklips Performance Cult, initiated by ANOHNI and joined by a cabal of fellow artists, drag queens, punks, nightlife veterans and students, performed a new play every Monday night at 1:00 a.m. at the Pyramid Club on 101 Avenue A. 
            Blacklips never courted mainstream attention. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the group left a sustaining impression within New York’s late night subculture by melding hysterical drag, surreal horror, and disconcerting tenderness. 
            Blacklips: Her Life and Her Many, Many Deaths, ANOHNI and coeditor Marti Wilkerson lay bare the collective’s archives in photographs, scripts, and the assembled ephemera from more than one hundred and twenty original “plays.”

            The book features a wealth of archival material, including photographs, scripts, images from newly digitised film and video recordings, texts from participants and audience members, and an introduction by Lia Gangitano. 
            Through these materials, ANOHNI and co-editor Marti Wilkerson offer readers an intimate look at the creative and cultural context that gave rise to Blacklips. The Blacklips Performance Cult was known for its innovative and provocative performances, which often explored themes of sexuality, gender and mortality.

        <span class="brödtext" id="first-paragraph"> While Blacklips was short-lived, its influence can still be felt today. The group's commitment to pushing boundaries and challenging norms has inspired generations of artists and performers. By documenting the history of Blacklips, ANOHNI and Wilkerson have ensured that this important cultural movement will not be forgotten. 
            The Blacklips Bar: Androgyns and Deviants — Industrial Romance for Bruised and Battered Angels, 1992–1995 compilation combines original recordings and select DJ tracks from the Blacklips vaults. The double album vinyl edition is illustrated and designed by ANOHNI, and includes previously unseen ephemera and extensive liner notes by the artist.

            Staging collectively conceived plays set Blacklips apart from other expressions of creativity in nightlife of the era, aligning the group with predecessors such as The Cockettes, Angels of Light, Bloolips and Theater of the Ridiculous. Blacklips members built sets from garbage and industrial refuse that they found in the streets of the East Village,
            in homage to Jack Smith and the aesthetics of post apocalyptic punk. The group staged spectacles that were alternately surreal, slapstick,  violent and absurd, often ended with a pile of bodies on stage.

            Blacklips: Her Life and Her Many, Many Deaths, ANOHNI and coeditor Marti Wilkerson lay bare the collective’s archives in photographs, scripts, and the assembled ephemera from more than one hundred and twenty original “plays.” As Blacklips was the first showcase for ANOHNI’s music, this compilation features remastered original recordings by ANOHNI, plus DJ tracks by artists including New York legend Joey Arias in his incarnation as BIllie Holiday, LA death rock founder Rozz Williams, avant-garde icon Diamanda Galás, UK punk pioneer Dave Vanian, underground actress Edith Massey, London surrealist Leigh Bowery and his band Minty, and studio recordings by coke, James F. Murphy, Sissy Fitt and Ebony Jet. Dialogue, sound effects and ambient textures add to the cacophony of passion, stark violence, beauty, heartbreak and maniacal humor.

            The work of Blacklips Performance Cult was unearthed for the first time at 13 Ways to Die, a recent exhibit at Participant Inc. in NYC, hailed by The New Yorker’s Hilton Als as “exquisite, emotional, and haunting.” ANOHNI will join in conversation at the New York Public Library on March 9th.</p></span>
