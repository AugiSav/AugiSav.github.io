        <span class="brödtext" id="first-paragraph">From June 1992 to March 1995, in the midst of the AIDS crisis in NYC, an extraordinary theatrical collective emerged from the queer underground. 
            Blacklips Performance Cult, initiated by ANOHNI and joined by a cabal of fellow artists, drag queens, punks, nightlife veterans and students, performed a new play every Monday night at 1:00 a.m. at the Pyramid Club on 101 Avenue A. 
            Blacklips never courted mainstream attention.

            <br>
            However, the group left a sustaining impression within New York’s late night subculture by melding hysterical drag, surreal horror, and disconcerting tenderness. 
            Blacklips: Her Life and Her Many, Many Deaths, ANOHNI and coeditor Marti Wilkerson lay bare the collective’s archives in photographs, scripts, and the assembled ephemera from more than one hundred and twenty original “plays.”

            The book features a wealth of archival material, including photographs, scripts, images from newly digitised film and video recordings, texts from participants and audience members, and an introduction by Lia Gangitano. 
            Through these materials, ANOHNI and co-editor Marti Wilkerson offer readers an intimate look at the creative and cultural context that gave rise to Blacklips. The Blacklips Performance Cult was known for its innovative and provocative performances, which often explored themes of sexuality, gender and mortality. 
            The group's members were primarily queer artists and activists, and their work was deeply informed by the political and social struggles of the time.</p></span>

        <span class="brödtext" id="first-paragraph"> While Blacklips was short-lived, its influence can still be felt today. The group's commitment to pushing boundaries and challenging norms has inspired generations of artists and performers. By documenting the history of Blacklips, ANOHNI and Wilkerson have ensured that this important cultural movement will not be forgotten.
